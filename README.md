# bash-remove0

 Bash script that removes all zero length ordinary files in the directory (including those in the
subdirectories at all levels) passed as an optional argument. If you do not specify the directory argument,
the script uses the current working directory as the default argument. This problem is for practicing bash
programming skills. I know there is a very easy way to achieve the goal with find.
